# Java Portfolio

This is a collection of my basic Java projects where I practice and experiment with Java code. The portfolio includes simple programs to help build my understanding of the Java programming language. As I continue to learn, I will be adding more advanced projects, including algorithms and data structures.

## Technologies Used
- Java SE (Standard Edition)

## Projects
- **Calculator**: A basic calculator application that can perform simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Pyramids**: Implemented several pyramid patterns (4-5 different types), which include patterns like right-angled, inverted, and other variations using loops.

I am constantly updating this portfolio as I learn new Java concepts and work on more complex projects.
